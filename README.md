# Sendora Website Project

## Project Overview
This project is a fully functional website for Sendora, featuring various sections that showcase the company's AI-powered sales automation capabilities. The website is built using Next.js and React, with a focus on creating engaging and interactive user experiences.

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Next.js structure with the following main directories:

- `/public`: Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
- `/src`
  - `/components`: Reusable React components
  - `/pages`: Next.js routing
  - `/styles`: Global and module-specific styles
  - `/utils`: Helper functions
  - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks
  - `/context`: React context providers
  - `/data`: Static JSON data

## Sections
The website consists of the following sections, in order:

1. Navbar (navigation)
2. Hero Section
3. SaaS Snapshot section
4. AI Recordings Section
5. Features Snippet Section
6. Use Cases Section
7. Overview Section
8. End Goal Section
9. Case Studies Section
10. FAQ section
11. Footer

## Development Process
Each section will be developed individually, with its own components and animations. The development process will involve merging these sections into a cohesive website, ensuring all functionalities remain intact.

## Current Status
As of now, the Hero Section has been implemented. Subsequent sections will be added and integrated as development progresses.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the Navbar component
2. Integrate the existing Hero Section
3. Develop and integrate the SaaS Snapshot section
4. Continue with the remaining sections in the specified order
